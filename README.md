### Ansible Roles
#### To create an Ansible role directory structure using Ansible Galaxy, you can use the ansible-galaxy command-line tool. Here's how you can do it:

#### Create a new role with the desired name:
```
ansible-galaxy init myrole
```

This will create a directory named myrole with the required role structure.

##### The directory structure will look like this:
```
myrole/
  ├── defaults/
  │   └── main.yml
  ├── files/
  ├── handlers/
  │   └── main.yml
  ├── meta/
  │   └── main.yml
  ├── tasks/
  │   └── main.yml
  ├── templates/
  ├── tests/
  │   ├── inventory/
  │   └── test.yml
  └── vars/
      └── main.yml
```      
###### Here's a brief description of each directory:
```
defaults/: This directory is used to store default variables for the role.
files/: This directory is used to store files that will be copied to the target system.
handlers/: This directory is used to store handlers for the role.
meta/: This directory is used to store metadata for the role, such as dependencies and supported platforms.
tasks/: This directory is used to store the main tasks file for the role.
templates/: This directory is used to store template files that can be customized during deployment.
tests/: This directory is used for testing the role.
vars/: This directory is used to store variables specific to the role.
You can add your role-specific tasks, variables, handlers, and other files within these directories as needed.

Remember to adjust the role name (myrole in this example) to match the name of your desired role.

```
